Simulacrum of a Pascaline Calculator
I was interested in the functionality of mechanical computers/ calculators and
came across the "Pascaline", an arithmetic machine invented by Blaise Pascal in
the 17th century. This project is meant to be an accompaniment to a real-life
project of recreating a Pascaline using modern 3d printing techniques. The
digital simulation is just an exercise in understanding the functions of the
calculator and configuring it to do more things than it could in real life-
notably switching the base arithmetic and memory of the calculator on a whim.
